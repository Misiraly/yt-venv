# TODO
 - tidy up existing code:
   - download/playing mechanism is ugly, risky and bloated
   - printing mechanism is not too coherent
   - ui_first objects' printing might be very inefficient
 - add playlist: creates a playlist from numbers provided
 - search playlist: shows existing playlists
 - possibilty to jump to timestamps, 10s back-forth

# Partially DONE
 - add "popularity" counter: # of times songs has been listened to 
   (- maybe weighed by time? or slated by periods (weeks, months, year...))
 - add "most listened to" tab: songs in order of number of listens
   (- maybe tab that slates through periods as well)

# DONE
 - random: gives 5 random choices, first is automatically chosen (=='y')
 - delhusa djon: plays Nika se Perimeno over and over
 - download & store songs in a library instead of downloading them everytime,
 read and play already existing songs from the library
