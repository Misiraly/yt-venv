Implement entry points:
 - random: gives 5 random choices, first is automatically chosen (=='y')
 - delhusa djon: plays Nika se Perimeno over and over
 - add playlist: creates a playlist from numbers provided
 - search playlist: shows existing playlists
 - add "popularity" counter: # of times songs has been listened to
   (- maybe weighed by time? or slated by periods (weeks, months, year...))
 - add "most listened to" tab: songs in order of number of listens
   (- maybe tab that slates through periods as well)
