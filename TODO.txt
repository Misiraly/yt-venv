# TODO
 - CHECK IF THE FILENAME TO BE DOWNLOADED ALREADY EXISTS!
 - add playlist: creates a playlist from numbers provided
 - search playlist: shows existing playlists
 - implement better GUI -- maybe with curses... it may be necessary to be able
to govern a whole screen, not just the last line of the cmd
   - possibility to toggle magnitude of seconds that can be jumped while
   playing, the magnitude of the jump needs to be displayed above the player...
 - tidy up existing code:
   - download/playing mechanism could be more robust, ie., what if a music file
   doesn't exist but we have it listed in our library?
   - printing mechanism is not too coherent
   - ui_first objects' printing might be very inefficient
   - ui_first decision making -- it is with if-else statements, but couldn't be
   it done better with a dictionary?

# Partially DONE
 - add "popularity" counter: # of times songs has been listened to 
   (- maybe weighed by time? or slated by periods (weeks, months, year...))
 - add "most listened to" tab: songs in order of number of listens
   (- maybe tab that slates through periods as well)

# DONE
 - re-download song for better quality
 - timestamps wrongly displayed, duration sorted in a dumb way
 - random: gives 5 random choices, first is automatically chosen (=='y')
 - delhusa djon: plays Nika se Perimeno over and over
 - download & store songs in a library instead of downloading them everytime,
 read and play already existing songs from the library
 - delete songs from table and library
 - possibilty to jump to timestamps, 10s back-forth
use number keys to get to the corresponding 10% mark (key 8->80%...)

# ABANDONED
 - create a better decision tree. Since decisions are executed on a graph, maybe
a decision matrix could be in order
    > Looking at it better, a little tweak was more than enough.
 - download/playing mechanism is ugly, risky and bloated
    > not as relevant, rewritten as above.
